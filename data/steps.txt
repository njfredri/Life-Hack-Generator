First rub the tube of glue stick with body cream was to help the glue come off. And then I use hot glue gun to draw either shapes, dots or swirls the on tube of glue stick in shapes of ring. boom: some rings
All you need is a glass vase/jar/cup/wine bottle, a hot glue gun and 2 of sprays paint. Well it might actually take you a few minutes to decide what pattern you will make on the vase with the glue. Set your glue gun on medium or low and have plenty of back up sticks. Slowly follow you pattern. Don't worry if you mess up, when the hot glue dries you can simply peel it off. Take outside to a ventilated area and apply two coats on the outside of the vase with spray paint. I used a golden paint and let it dry about 5 minutes and then I used a pink paint between each coat to avoid drips.

Got a loose ring? This genius hack lets you easily size down a ring with just some hot glue. Work on parchment or wax paper. It's not permanent as you can peel off the glue.

So be warned. There are some other products on the market like the silicone one linked below. However, the best way is to get a professional jeweler to resize rings.
